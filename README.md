# Hart Book

Hart Vocab is a website dedicated to helping learn vocabulary. It is being rebuilt and modernized after getting hacked by Russians. It allows the user to tailor lists of words to study in more dynamic ways: definition displays, selecting buttons, or writing in answers. It is also a tool for instructors. Students can be assigned lists to study, then teachers can easily create quizzes from those lists. Additionally, the student's progress can be monitored.

## Installing
The files were all written in Java 1.7, MySQL 5.5, HTML 5, and JavaScript. The originals were running on Ant and TomCat, but now are being revised for Glassfish or WildFly.

Being a work in progress, this is not ready for prime time. It will be finished and loaded on the www.hartvocab.com site in the future.
